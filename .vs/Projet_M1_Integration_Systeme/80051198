This exception is thrown when the call stack exceeds its maximum size. \r\n\r\nThis might be happening because the \u0060SelectedName\u0060 property getter is recursively calling itself, leading to an infinite loop. The \u0060SelectedName\u0060 property getter is returning the \u0060SelectedName\u0060 property, which results in the getter being called again, and so on. This creates an infinite loop, which eventually causes the call stack to overflow and the \u0060StackOverflowException\u0060 to be thrown.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, you should modify the \u0060SelectedName\u0060 property getter to return the private field \u0060selectedName\u0060 instead of calling the getter method recursively. This will break the infinite loop and prevent the \u0060StackOverflowException\u0060 from being thrown.\r\n\r\nIf this doesn\u0027t solve the issue, you can try debugging the code to see what other parts of the application might be contributing to the error. You can also provide more information about the error, such as the full stack trace and any relevant code, to help diagnose the issue more accurately.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["How can I modify the SelectedName property getter to return the private field?","Can you explain what a StackOverflowException is?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"ExplainException","LoggedSkillInvocations":null}
